# Vessel Extremes
This repository holds the analyses, data and output for two projects related to the evolution of vessel morphology in plants.

## Macroevolutionary analyses
Macroevolutionary analyses include two primary scripts that are found in the analysis folder. First, we performed an OUwie analysis in the file *./analysis/OUwieAnalysis_Freeze.Rmd* (including code for matching of tree and original data sources). Second, we developed a novel method for relating a continuous predictor to vessel size and analyzed the data in the file *./analysis/ContinuousTheta_Freeze+Evergreen.Rmd*. All relevant data is included in in the *./datasets/* folder.
