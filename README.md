# Vessel Extremes
This repository holds the analyses, data and output for two projects related to the evolution of vessel morphology in plants.
## Part I - Environmental extremes and conduit anatomy
Analyses of conduit size in response to climatic variables at the extremes of a species' range:

1. OUwie analysis of deciduous/evergreen and freeze tolerant/non-freeze tolerant species (Josef)
2. Transition regression analysis (Will)
3. SLOUCH analysis (Will?)

## Part II - Growth form and conduit anatomy
Analyses of the evolutionary allometry of vessel number and size, as well as climate effects on lumen size and size ratio:

1. Prepare and match datasets
2. Fit bayou models to test for relationships between 
  1. The relationship between vessel size and vessel number
        1. An exploratory reversible-jump analysis to find clades with divergent allometric scaling relationships
        2. An analysis that gives separate allometric relationships for climbing species
  2. The relationship between vessel size ratio (ln(Vs/Vn)) and climatic variables
  3. The relationship between lumen size (lnVs + lnVn) and climatic variables
